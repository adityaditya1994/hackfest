Local Development Instructions

Database Setup

Use the provided data model to create a SQLite database locally.

Populate with sample or real anonymized data from connected HR platforms.

API Layer

Build RESTful APIs in Node.js/Express to serve frontend components.

Ensure endpoints support filtering, pagination, and aggregation where needed.

AI Chatbot Assistant

Integrate a local LLM (recommended: LLaMA or similar) to power the chatbot.

The chatbot should:

Accept user queries in natural language

Access the local SQLite database and API endpoints

Perform ad hoc analysis (e.g., "Show all high-risk L3 employees")

Read and summarize the current UI page (DOM parsing or component state access)

Act as a co-pilot for HR and People Managers

NLP Search

Implement a smart search bar that interprets natural language and routes to the appropriate data view or API call (e.g., "Show me attrition trends for my team")

Architecture Consideration

Design the backend and data access layers with plug-and-play connectors to easily support more HR tools
